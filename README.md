# C - Binary Trees

This project is part of the **Holberton School** curriculum.  
It focuses on understanding how **binary trees** work in the C programming language — how to create them, link nodes, and analyze their properties such as height, depth, and balance.

Working on this project helped me improve my understanding of **data structures** and **recursion in C**.


## Project Description

A **binary tree** is a data structure where each node has at most two children — a left and a right child.  
In this project, I implemented several functions that perform various operations on binary trees, including creation, insertion, traversal, and checking for different properties.

The project was written in **C** and tested on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what a **binary tree** is.  
- Learn the difference between a **binary tree** and a **binary search tree (BST)**.  
- Know what **depth**, **height**, and **size** mean in a tree.  
- Learn how to **traverse** a tree (preorder, inorder, postorder).  
- Identify **leaves**, **roots**, **siblings**, and **uncles**.  
- Understand what makes a tree **complete**, **full**, or **perfect**.



## Requirements
